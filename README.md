## Features
1.  ***testing mode***
  * Support manual testing mode:
    * Write your tests into `MANUAL_TESTS[]` variable of `quadr_equ_solver_funcs.cpp` file
    * Or write your tests into `PATH_AUTO_TESTS`, launch auto tests mode and enter 0 in tests generate number question. In this case programm won't erase data from your tests file
  * Support auto testing mode
    * Generates chosen number of random quadratic equations into file `PATH_AUTO_TESTS`
  * Suppor reading tests from array and file

2.  ***Self-written random generator***

    Based on *Linear congruential generator*:

    $X_{i+1} = (aX_{i} + c) \mod m$

    With *Borland C/C++ constants* ([see other constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator))

    $m = 2^{32};\ a = 22695477;\ c = 1;$
    Writes current seed into file located by `PATH_CUR_SEED[]` (see section: ([Settings](https://github.com/I1Va/quadr_equ/tree/progress?tab=readme-ov-file#settings)))

3. ***Color output***
  
4. ***Quadratic equation parsing mode***
  * Parse entered quadratic equation  
  * Process extra spaces
  * Maintains x**2 or x^2 records of x² member  

## Settings

You can change system variables in file `quadr_equ/quadr_config.h`:

`PATH_AUTO_TESTS[]` — path to auto tests generating in testing mode 


`PATH_CUR_SEED[]` — path to file in which random generator will write current random number


`PATH_EXAMPLE[]` — path, where example quadratic equation is located (from example mode)
